# Goals:

  * Compare MountainSort output to manual sort. This needs (1) conversion from .ntt to four CSC files ([#4](https://github.com/vandermeerlab/MountainSort-Hackathon/issues/4) for MATLAB) and (2) conversion from CSC files to .mda in order to run MountainSort on previously recorded .ntt data (done, [#2](https://github.com/vandermeerlab/MountainSort-Hackathon/issues/2) for MATLAB). Then, (3) .t files need to be converted into a manualfirings.mda file for comparison ([#3](https://github.com/vandermeerlab/MountainSort-Hackathon/issues/3) for MATLAB) 
  * Compare decoding accuracy for MountainSort vs. manual. This needs (1) loading of MountainSort output into a ts (done, [#1](https://github.com/vandermeerlab/MountainSort-Hackathon/issues/1) for MATLAB), (2) integration into data analysis pipeline, and (3) code for comparing output.
